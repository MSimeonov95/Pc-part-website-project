website for pc parts that i made for a project with a database that i havent uploaded to github yet so it doesnt work fully but you can see the code and the frontend. the point is theres a secret admin page that you can add parts with and a login system. theres seperate databases made with phpmyadmin, one for the parts the other for the logins, the ordering system exists in the frontend but it doesnt have a backend.  im uploading this so theres some of my web projects until i make my portfolio website
